I’m **Jerry Lin** — a statistician and researcher working in the field of biostatistics and biomedical data science.

This blog documents in-progress research, thoughts and ramblings across several domains including **biostatistics/biomedical data science**, **real-world evidence**, **demographics**, and **election forecasting**.
 .  
My work is unified by a single theme:

> **How do systems stay stable when individual components are noisy, biased, or constantly changing?**  
> — whether those “systems” are biological, statistical, financial, or political.
