I’m **Jerry Lin** — a statistician and researcher working in the field of biostatistics and biomedical data science.

This blog documents in-progress research, thoughts and ramblings across several domains including **biostatistics/biomedical data science**, **real-world evidence**, **demographics**, and **election forecasting**.
 .  
My work is unified by a single theme:

> **How do systems stay stable when individual components are noisy, biased, or constantly changing?**  
> — whether those “systems” are biological, statistical, financial, or political.

# Why This Blog Exists

This blog is a working lab notebook, not a polished journal.

You’ll find:

- half-finished ideas  
- simulations designed to break intuitions  
- technical write-ups    
- reflections on how stability, uncertainty, and human decision-making shape all these domains

If any post sparks an idea, feel free to open an issue or discussion.
